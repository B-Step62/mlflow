# (Advanced) Low-level Client APIs

The <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient">`MlflowClient`</APILink> class provides a set of low-level APIS for fine-grained control over creating, manipulating, and retrieving traces.

:::tip

We recommend using the client APIs only when the high-level APIs like `@mlflow.trace` and `mlflow.start_span` do not satisfy your requirements. See [this page](./manual-instrumentation.mdx) for the usage of those high-level APIs.

:::


* You have to distinguish a trace and a span separately.


## Starting a Trace

Unlike with the decorator and context manager, the client API requires that you explicitly start a trace before adding child spans. This initial API call starts the root span for the trace, providing a context request_id that is used for associating subsequent spans to the root span.

To start a new trace, use the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.start_trace">`MlflowClient.start_trace`</APILink> method. This method creates a new trace and returns the root span object.
