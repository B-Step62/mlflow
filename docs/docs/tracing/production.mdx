# Tracing in Production

MLflow Tracing is **Production Ready**.

## Using OpenTelemetry Collector for Exporting Traces

Traces generated by MLflow are compatible with the [OpenTelemetry trace specs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#span).
Therefore, MLflow Tracing supports exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which can then be used to export traces to various backends such as Jaeger, Zipkin, and AWS X-Ray.

By default, MLflow exports traces to the MLflow Tracking Server. To enable exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable (or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`) to the target URL of the OpenTelemetry Collector **before starting any trace**.

```python
import mlflow
import os

# Set the endpoint of the OpenTelemetry Collector
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:4317/v1/traces"
# Optionally, set the service name to group traces
os.environ["OTEL_SERVICE_NAME"] = "<your-service-name>"

# Trace will be exported to the OTel collector at http://localhost:4317/v1/traces
with mlflow.start_span(name="foo") as span:
    span.set_inputs({"a": 1})
    span.set_outputs({"b": 2})
```

:::warning
MLflow only exports traces to a single destination. When the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable is configured, MLflow will **not** export traces to the MLflow Tracking Server and you will not see traces in the MLflow UI.

Similarly, if you deploy the model to the [Databricks Model Serving with tracing enabled](https://docs.databricks.com/en/mlflow/mlflow-tracing.html#use-mlflow-tracing-in-production), using the OpenTelemetry Collector will result in traces not being recorded in the Inference Table.

### Configurations

MLflow uses the standard OTLP Exporter for exporting traces to OpenTelemetry Collector instances. Thereby, you can use [all of the configurations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/) supported by OpenTelemetry. The following example configures the OTLP Exporter to use HTTP protocol instead of the default gRPC and sets custom headers:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317/v1/traces"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL="http/protobuf"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="api_key=12345"
```
