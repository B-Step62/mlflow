# MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability



**MLflow Tracing** is a feature that enhances LLM observability in your Generative AI (GenAI) applications by capturing detailed information about the execution of your application's services.
Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

* **FREE and OPEN** - MLflow is Open Source. You don't need to pay dollars to adding observability to your GenAI stack. No SaaS sign-up is required. Your trace data is hosted on your machine.

* **STANDARD** - MLflow Tracing is compatible with **OpenTelemetry**, an industry standard observability spec. This allows you to export your trace data into various different storage options, such as Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, and more.

* **Framework Support** - MLflow Tracing integrated with 15+ GenAI libraries, such as OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, and more.

* **End-to-End** - MLflow is designed for managing end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. In conjunction with MLflow's full tracking and evaluation capabilities, you can bring the full potential out of the trace data.

* **Community** - MLflow is supported by strong Open Source community. 10K
