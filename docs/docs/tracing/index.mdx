# MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability



**MLflow Tracing** is a feature that enhances LLM observability in your Generative AI (GenAI) applications by capturing detailed information about the execution of your application's services.
Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

## Why Choose MLflow?

* **ü™Ω FREE and OPEN** - MLflow is Open Source and 100% FREE. You don‚Äôt need to pay extra SaaS costs for adding observability to your GenAI stack. Your trace data is hosted on your own machine.

* **ü•á STANDARD** - MLflow Tracing is compatible with **OpenTelemetry**, an industry standard observability spec. You can to export your trace data to various different services used in your existing observability stack, such as Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, and more.


* **ü§ù Framework Support** - MLflow Tracing integrates with 15+ GenAI libraries, such as OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, and more. See [Automatic Tracing](#automatic-tracing) section for the full list of the integrated libraries.

* **üîÑ End-to-End** - MLflow is designed for managing end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. In conjunction with its model tracking and evaluation capabilities, you can bring the full potential out of the trace data.

* **üë• Community** - MLflow is supported by strong Open Source community and a part of Linux Foundation. MLflow gains 19,000+ Github Stars and 15MM+ monthly downloads.
