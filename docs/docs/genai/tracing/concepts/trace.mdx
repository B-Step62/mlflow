# Trace Concepts

This document provides a detailed overview of the MLflow Trace data model. Understanding this model is key to leveraging MLflow Tracing for observability and analysis of your Generative AI applications.

MLflow Traces are designed to be **compatible with OpenTelemetry specifications**, a widely adopted industry standard for observability. This ensures interoperability and allows MLflow Traces to be exported and used with other OpenTelemetry-compatible systems. MLflow enhances the basic OpenTelemetry Span model by defining specific structures and attributes for Generative AI use cases, providing richer context and deeper insight into quality and performance.

## What is Tracing?
Tracing is an observability technique that captures the complete execution flow of a request through your application. Unlike traditional logging that captures discrete events, tracing creates a detailed map of how data flows through your system, recording every operation, transformation, and decision point.

In the context of GenAI applications, tracing becomes essential because these systems involve complex, multi-step workflows that are difficult to debug and optimize without complete visibility into their execution.

## Core Structure: Trace = TraceInfo + TraceData

At a high level, an MLflow **Trace** is composed of two primary objects:

**<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink>**: Metadata that aids in explaining the origination of the trace, the status of the trace, information about the total execution time, etc. This includes tags that provide additional context for the trace, such as the user, session, and developer-provided key:value pairs. Tags can be used for searching or filtering traces.

**<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">TraceData</APILink>**: The actual payload, which contains the instrumented <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">Span</APILink> objects that capture your application's step-by-step execution from input to output.

## TraceInfo: Metadata and Context

The <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink> within MLflow's tracing feature aims to provide a lightweight snapshot of critical data about the overall trace. In Python SDK, <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink> is designed as a dataclass object that contains metadata about the trace.

This metadata includes information about the trace's origin, status, and various other data that aids in retrieving and filtering traces when used with <APILink fn="mlflow.search_traces" /> and for navigation of traces within the MLflow UI.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core-fields" label="Core Fields" default>
    **`trace_id`** (str): The primary identifier for the trace.

    **`trace_location`** (TraceLocation): The location where the trace is stored, represented as a TraceLocation object. MLflow currently supports MLflow Experiment as a trace location.

    **`request_time`** (int): Start time of the trace, in milliseconds.

    **`state`** (TraceState): State of the trace, represented as a TraceState enum. Can be one of [`OK`, `ERROR`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `STATE_UNSPECIFIED`].

    **`execution_duration`** (Optional[int]): Duration of the trace, in milliseconds.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preview-fields" label="Request & Response">
    **`request_preview`** (Optional[str]): Request to the model/agent, equivalent to the input of the root span but JSON-encoded and can be truncated.

    **`response_preview`** (Optional[str]): Response from the model/agent, equivalent to the output of the root span but JSON-encoded and can be truncated.

    These preview fields provide a quick overview of what the trace processed without needing to examine the detailed span data.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="metadata-fields" label="Metadata & Organization">
    **`client_request_id`** (Optional[str]): Client supplied request ID associated with the trace. This could be used to identify the trace/request from an external system that produced the trace, e.g., a session ID in a web application.

    **`trace_metadata`** (dict[str, str]): Key-value pairs associated with the trace. They are designed for immutable values like run ID associated with the trace.

    **`tags`** (dict[str, str]): Tags associated with the trace. They are designed for mutable values, that can be updated after the trace is created via MLflow UI or API.

  </TabItem>

### Storage Layout

The data that is contained in the `TraceInfo` object is used to populate the trace view page within the MLflow tracking UI. `TraceInfo` is a lightweight metadata object, hence can be stored directly in a relational database. For example, if you are running MLflow Tracking Server on SQL database such as PostgreSQL, `TraceInfo` is stored as a single row in the trace table and support efficient query with indexes.

### Trace Tags

Tags are key-value pairs that can be used to annotate the trace. They are designed for mutable values, that can be updated after the trace is created via MLflow UI or API. Tags are stored in the `TraceInfo` object, so useful for grouping traces and efficiently querying them. Visit [Setting Trace Tags](/genai/tracing/attach-tags) for more details about the usage of tags.

## TraceData: Container of Spans

The MLflow <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">TraceData</APILink> object, accessible via `trace.data`, is a container of <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">Span</APILink> object. This is where the actual execution details are stored, including the request and response data, latency of each step, input and output messages to LLMs, retrieved documents from vector stores, tool call parameters, etc.

Spans in a trace forms a hierarchy through parent-child connections. Each span details a specific unit of work.

For example, the following picture illustrates a set of spans that are organized in a tree structure in a trace. Each line represents a span, where the tree-structure is formed by the curly edges between lines. For example, the root span is "agent", which links to three children spans: 2 LLm calls and 1 tool handling.

<img src="/images/llms/tracing/schema/span_architecture.png" alt="Span Architecture" style={{width: '80%'}} />

The corresponding pseudo Python object looks like this:

```python
[
    Span(name="agent", parent=None),
    Span(name="o3-mini.chat.completions", parent="agent"),
    Span(name="handle_tool_calls", parent="agent"),
    Span(name="retriever_tool", parent="handle_tool_calls"),
    Span(name="qdrant.query", parent="retriever_tool"),
    Span(name="o3-mini.chat.completions", parent="agent"),
]
```

### Storage Layout

Spans are relatively large objects compared to `TraceInfo`, because it contains rich information about each execution step, such as the full message history input to an LLM call. Therefore, MLflow stores them in artifact storage rather than in the database. This allows you to handle large number of traces with cheaper costs and minimum impact to the performance of typical filtering and grouping operations for traces.
