# Trace Tags

The `tags` property in MLflow's `TraceInfo` object is used to provide additional context for the trace. These tags can be used for searching, filtering, or providing additional information about the trace.

The tags are key-value pairs, and they are mutable. This means that you can add, modify, or remove tags at any time, even after the trace has been logged to an experiment.

## Standard Tags

MLflow uses a set of standard tags for common contextual information about users, sessions and the environment, which enable enhanced filtering and grouping capabilities within the MLflow UI and SDK:

**`mlflow.trace.session`**: Standard tag for session ID

**`mlflow.trace.user`**: Standard tag for user ID

**`mlflow.source.name`**: The entry point or script that generated the trace

**`mlflow.source.git.commit`**: If run from a Git repository, the commit hash of the source code

**`mlflow.source.type`**: The type of source that generated the trace, commonly `PROJECT` (for MLflow Project runs) or `NOTEBOOK` (if run from a notebook)

## Custom Tags for Advanced Use Cases

For enterprise and distributed applications, custom tags enable powerful filtering and organization:

### Business Context Tags

```python
# Business-specific identification
mlflow.update_current_trace(
    tags={
        "business.user_id": "user123",
        "business.tenant_id": "tenant_456",
        "business.cost_center": "engineering",
        "business.department": "ai_platform",
    }
)
```

### Deployment and Environment Tags

```python
# Deployment context
mlflow.update_current_trace(
    tags={
        "deployment.environment": "production",
        "deployment.region": "us-west-2",
        "deployment.service": "recommendation_engine",
        "deployment.version": "v2.3.1",
    }
)
```

### Performance and Quality Tags

```python
# Performance monitoring
mlflow.update_current_trace(
    tags={
        "performance.tier": "premium",
        "quality.confidence_threshold": "0.8",
        "feature.experimental": "true",
        "monitoring.alert_level": "high",
    }
)
```
