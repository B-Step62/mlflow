  "description": "In conversational AI applications, it is common that users interact with the model multiple times within a single conversation session. Since each interaction generates a trace in the typical MLflow setup, it is useful to group these traces together to analyze the conversation as a whole. You can achieve this by attaching the session ID as a tag to each trace.",
